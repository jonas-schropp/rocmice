# Introduction

`rocmice` is an R package to work with ROC (Receiver Operating Curves) in 
multiply imputed data. Using multiple imputation in prediction modelling can 
be helpful when missingness patterns don't follow MCAR and complete case 
analysis, single imputation or similar methods could seriously bias the model. 
Using pooled ROC and AUC makes evaluation of such models easier.

# Installation

You can install the package with
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/jonas-schropp/rocmice.git")
```

And then call it like any other package using 
```{r}
library(rocmice)
```
