rocmice
================

# Introduction

`rocmice` is an R package to work with ROC (Receiver Operating Curves)
in multiply imputed data. Using multiple imputation in prediction
modelling can be helpful when missingness patterns donâ€™t follow MCAR and
complete case analysis, single imputation or similar methods could
seriously bias the model. Using pooled ROC and AUC makes evaluation of
such models easier.

# Installation

You can install the package with

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/jonas-schropp/rocmice.git")
```

And then call it like any other package using

``` r
library(rocmice)
```
